# Design with Code

We are designers that don't want to stop where design gets handed off to development. 

* We want to understand how the technology that we are using works and how we can use it to bring our designs to live. 
* We want to touch and feel the matter that we are working with instead of hoping that the designs we created in Figma get implemented in the way we envisioned.
* We want to optimize the experience by tweaking the design where it finally counts: in the code.

This place is meant to help other designers to take the first steps into creating their own prototypes in code. It addresses designers that have no coding skills as well as designers that have some experience with web design, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS already (you notice, for now we focus on web-based applications).

This place is accompanied by a series of articles on the *SAP Community* 

* 

We will focus on technologies that are provided by SAP for the [SAP Fiori Design System](https://experience.sap.com/fiori-design/).
