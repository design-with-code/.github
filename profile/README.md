# Design with Code

![Part 1 teaser](https://github.com/design-with-code/.github/assets/46745939/31ca825b-d543-46af-8478-38e40db12d31)

We are designers that don't want to stop where design gets handed off to development. 

* We want to understand how the technology that we are using works and how we can use it to bring our designs to live. 
* We want to touch and feel the matter that we are working with instead of hoping that the designs we created in Figma get implemented in the way we envisioned.
* We want to optimize the experience by tweaking the design where it finally counts: in the code.

This place is meant to help other designers to take the first steps into creating their own prototypes in code. It addresses designers that have no coding skills as well as designers that have some experience with web design, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS already (you notice, for now we focus on web-based applications). We will focus on technologies that are provided by SAP for the [SAP Fiori Design System](https://experience.sap.com/fiori-design/).

* **[SAP Web Components](https://github.com/design-with-code/sap-web-components)**
* **[SAPUI5](https://github.com/design-with-code/sapui5)**

This place is accompanied by a series of articles *Designing with Code* that appear on the *SAP Community*: 

* [Designing with Code](https://blogs.sap.com/2023/10/29/designing-with-code/) - why we think it is important for designers to start looking also into the technology they design for.
* [Crossing the Bridge](https://blogs.sap.com/2023/11/05/designing-with-code-part-2-crossing-the-bridge/) - why we are already coding without knowing and how we can best translate our knowledge from the design tool into code.
