# Design with Code

We are designers that don't want to stop where design gets handed off to development. 

* We want to understand how the technology that we are using works and how we can use it to bring our designs to live. 
* We want to touch and feel the matter that we are working with instead of hoping that the designs we created in Figma get implemented in the way we envisioned.
* We want to optimize the experience by tweaking the design where it finally counts: in the code.

This place is meant to help other designers to take the first steps into creating their own prototypes in code. It addresses designers that have no coding skills as well as designers that have some experience with web design, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS already (you notice, for now we focus on web-based applications).

We will focus on technologies that are provided by SAP for the [SAP Fiori Design System](https://experience.sap.com/fiori-design/).

This place contains repositories 
This repository contains resources and exercises that accompany a series of articles called "Designing with Code" published on the SAP community platform. The articles have the goal to motivate and help designers to start creating their own design prototypes using the available SAP technologies.

Many designers see the value in knowing more about the technology they use as basis for their designs on a daily basis, but the hurdle to get started is just to high, especially if they are busy in their daily routine and under pressure to deliver.

This series of articles gives an introduction to our main UI technologies and how they can be used by designers without the need to set up complicated development environments and server.

The following articles form part of this series :

Part 1: Change of Perspective, SAP Community - Introduction and motivation for this serieas of articles. The experience from my fellowship as product designer and the experience of creating my first own prototype using web components and later SAPUI5.
